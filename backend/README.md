# Stock Sentiment Tracker

This project scrapes information off of popular discussion boards, such as the wallstreetbets and stocks boards on Reddit, and analyzes the overall sentiment regarding any given publicly traded company. 

The script takes a company's stock ticker as input and scrapes recent (past week) data on discussion boards regarding it. It then evaluates the data using pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) to determine if the sentiment behind it is positive, negative, or neutral. It will then return the percentage of positive and negative sentiment posts.
